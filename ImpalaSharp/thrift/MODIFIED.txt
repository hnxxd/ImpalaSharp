Modification point from the original IDL.

 o Add namespace declaration for ImpalaSharp.
 o For avoiding compilation error about C#'s specification.
   C# prohibit to use same identifier between class name and its property name.
   
     e.g.) Query class that is generated from beeswax.thrift

     public partial class Query : TBase
     {
        public string Query {get;set;} // <- Can't declare this.
        
        -- snip --
     }
